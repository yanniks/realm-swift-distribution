# Realm Swift - Binary distribution repository

This repository can be used to integrate Realm without compiling the Realm sources with each build. The required `.xcframework` zip files are downloaded directly from the official Realm releases - as soon as an official repository is available that is used for binary distributions, this repository will be deprecated.
